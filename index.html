                <p> This is my new webpage to discuss my mail sorting and napping habits. I do nothing all day so I decided to enrich myself by learning to code, but I refuse to wear claw caps (even thought I look very handsome in them), so typing is rather hard. I've recruited one of the people that feeds me to do this work. I also don't know what he means when he talks about "tags" and "HTML" but I am definitely learning how to code.</p>
